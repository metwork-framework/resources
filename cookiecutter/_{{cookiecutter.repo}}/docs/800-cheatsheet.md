## `root` service commands

As `root` unix user:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `service metwork start` | start all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork stop` | stop all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork status` | check all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork start {{cookiecutter.repo}}` | start {{cookiecutter.repo}} metwork services |
| `service metwork stop {{cookiecutter.repo}}` | stop {{cookiecutter.repo}} metwork services |
| `service metwork status {{cookiecutter.repo}}` | check {{cookiecutter.repo}} metwork services |

> Note: if you don't have `service` command on your Linux distribution, you can use `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork` instead of `service metwork`. For example: `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork start` instead of `service metwork start`. If your Linux distribution uses `systemd`component, you can also start metwork services with classic `systemctl` commands.
{% endif %}

{% if cookiecutter.repo != "mfext" %}
## root files or directories

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/metwork.config.d/{{cookiecutter.repo}}/config.ini` | override the `{{cookiecutter.repo}}` module configuration at system level (note: the first line of this file must be `[INCLUDE_config.ini]`) |
| `/opt/metwork-{{cookiecutter.repo}}/config/config.ini` | default `{{cookiecutter.repo}}` module configuration (useful to see all configuration options) (**do not edit this file** => use the overriding previous file) |
{% if cookiecutter.repo in ["mfserv", "mfdata", "mfbase"] -%}
| `/etc/metwork.config.d/{{cookiecutter.repo}}/plugins/` | put some `.plugin` files here and they will be installed during `{{cookiecutter.repo}}` service startup, put some `.ini` file fragments here as `{plugin_name}.ini` and they will be used as configuration override for the specified plugin |
{% endif -%}
{% endif %}

## "load environment" commands

As a "not metwork" unix user (useless if you are logged as a "mfxxx" unix user as the "metwork environement" is already loaded):

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source /opt/metwork-{{cookiecutter.repo}}/share/interactive_profile` | load the {{cookiecutter.repo}} metwork interactive environment |
| `source /opt/metwork-{{cookiecutter.repo}}/share/profile` | load the {{cookiecutter.repo}} metwork environment (same as above but without fancy stuff about banner, colors and prompt) |
| `/opt/metwork-{{cookiecutter.repo}}/bin/{{cookiecutter.repo}}_wrapper {YOUR_COMMAND}`| execute the given command in the {{cookiecutter.repo}} metwork environment without changing anything to the current environment |

> Note: if you don't have `/opt/metwork-{{cookiecutter.repo}}` symbolic link, use `/opt/metwork-{{cookiecutter.repo}}-{BRANCH}` instead.

## module commands

{% if cookiecutter.repo == "mfext" %}
*(with the `mfext` environment loaded)*
{% else %}
As `{{cookiecutter.repo}}` user:
{% endif %}

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
{% if cookiecutter.repo != "mfext" -%}
| `{{cookiecutter.repo}}.start` | start {{cookiecutter.repo}} services |
| `{{cookiecutter.repo}}.stop` | stop {{cookiecutter.repo}} services |
| `{{cookiecutter.repo}}.status` | check {{cookiecutter.repo}} services |
{% endif -%}
| `layers` | list installed layers (loaded layers are prefixed by `(*)`), `layers --help` for more details |
| `layer_load {LAYER_NAME}` | load the given layer (which must be installed), example: `layer_load python2_devtools@mfext` |
| `layer_unload` | unload the given layer (which must be loaded), example: `layer_unload python2@mfext` |
| `components` | list installed software components (loaded components are prefixed by `(*)`), `components --help` for more details |
| `metwork_debug` | debug the current environment (layers, paths, versions...), useful for debugging or bug reporting |
| `outside {YOUR_COMMAND}`| execute the given command outside the metwork environment without changing anything to to the current environment |

## plugins management commands

As `{{cookiecutter.repo}}` unix user:

{% raw %}
{{plugin_ref_management_commands}}
{% endraw %}

{% endif %}

{% if cookiecutter.repo in ['mfserv', 'mfbase', 'mfdata'] %}
## plugins development commands and files

### bootstrapping and building

As `{{cookiecutter.repo}}` unix user, inside a plugin directory for `make` commands (you must have a `Makefile` and `config.ini` files inside the current working directory):

{% raw %}
{{plugin_ref_dev_commands}}
{% endraw %}

### interesting files inside the plugin directory

{% raw %}
{{plugin_ref_interesting_files}}
{% endraw %}

> Note: mandatory files are in **bold**, all these files are not created by default (it mainly depends on the template you used) but you can create them afterwards.
