## `root` service commands

As `root` unix user:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `service metwork start` | start all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork stop` | stop all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork status` | check all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork start {{cookiecutter.repo}}` | start {{cookiecutter.repo}} metwork services |
| `service metwork stop {{cookiecutter.repo}}` | stop {{cookiecutter.repo}} metwork services |
| `service metwork status {{cookiecutter.repo}}` | check {{cookiecutter.repo}} metwork services |

> Note: if you don't have `service` command on your Linux distribution, you can use `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork` instead of `service metwork`. For example: `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork start` instead of `service metwork start`. If your Linux distribution uses `systemd`component, you can also start metwork services with classic `systemctl` commands.
