# How to install/upgrade/remove a metwork package (with internet access)

## Prerequisites

You must:

- have configured the metwork yum repository. Please see [the corresponding document](configure_metwork_repo.md) document to do that.
- have an internet access on this computer

## Install a metwork package

You just have to execute the following command (as `root` user):

```bash
yum install metwork-{METWORK_PACKAGE_NAME}
```

with `{METWORK_PACKAGE_NAME}` replaced by `mfext`, `mfcom`, `mfbase`, `mfadmin`, `mfsysmon`, `mfserv` or `mfdata` depending of your needs.

For example, to install `mfserv` package:

```bash
yum install metwork-mfserv
```

Of course, you can install several packages on the same linux box.

You can start corresponding services (not necessary for `mfext` or `mfcom` packages) with the root command:

```bash
service metwork start
```

Or you can also reboot your computer (because metwork services are started automatically on boot).


## Uninstall a metwork package

To uninstall a given metwork package, please stop corresponding metwork services with the `root` command:

```bash
# note: this is not necessary with mfext or mfcom
# because there is no corresponding services
service metwork stop {METWORK_PACKAGE_NAME}
```

Then, use the following command (still as `root` user):

```bash
yum remove "metwork-{METWORK_PACKAGE_NAME}*"
```

## Uninstall all metwork packages

To uninstall all metwork packages, use following root commands:

```bash
# We stop metwork services
service metwork stop

# we remove metwork packages
yum remove "metwork-*"
```

## Upgrade all metwork packages

The same idea applies to upgrade.

For example, to upgrade all metwork packages on a computer, use following root commands:

```bash
# We stop metwork services
service metwork stop

# We upgrade metwork packages
yum upgrade "metwork-*"

# We start metwork services
service metwork start
```
